#001 The Flintstones

  Flintstones, meet the Flintstones
  They're the modern stone-age family
  From the town of Bedrock
  They're a page right out of history
  Let's ride with the family down the street
  Through the courtesy of Fred's two feet
  When you're with the Flintstones
  Have a yabba-dabba-doo time
  A dabba-doo time
  You'll have a gay old time
