#085 [Voice] Unmatched in his brave determination to deliver the news, Paperboy does daily battle with the forces of darkness and evil.
#086 [Voice] Paperboy: stopping at nothing to save the planet from deviant journalism.
#087 [Voice] Paperboy: he doesn't write the news; he just delivers it.
#088 [Voice] Risking his life for the public's right to be informed, Paperboy rides the sidewalks of this land delivering papers.
#089 [Voice] You realize, of course, this means war.
