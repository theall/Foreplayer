#001 The Flintstones

	Flintstones, meet the Flintstones
	They're the modern stone-age family
	From the town of Bedrock
	They're a page right out of history
	Let's ride with the family down the street
	Through the courtesy of Fred's two feet
	When you're with the Flintstones
	Have a yabba-dabba-doo time
	A dabba-doo time
	You'll have a gay old time
