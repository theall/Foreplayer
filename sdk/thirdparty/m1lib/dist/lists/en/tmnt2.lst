#063 Theme from "Pizza Power"

	Growing up in a glass bowl
	With chameleons, lizards and tadpoles
	It hardly enters your mind
	That there's something better than this
	A lettuce leaf and a carrot
	Maybe a seed from the parrot
	Believe me when I tell you
	The word gourmet just don't exist

	But pizza power
	A flying saucer food delight
	Pizza power
	That's what makes us feel alright
